# Bus Reservation Project

This C Project is used to book bus tickets.

It uses File handling.

It has various buses available and users can:-

1) View the Bus list i.e. which buses are available and what are their source city and destination

2) Buy tickets for any of the available buses

3) Cancel  their bookings

4) View the status of the bus i.e. how many seats and which seats are vacant and are available for booking.

It uses File Handling to store the information even after the program ends.

It uses password check to check the username and password so that no one can gain unauthorized access

If someone has entered wrong username and password for four consecutive times then they have to wait for 10 seconds before they can try again. This is to imporve the security.
